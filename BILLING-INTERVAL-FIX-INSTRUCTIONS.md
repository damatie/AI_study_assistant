# Quick Fix Summary: Billing Interval Issue

## What Was Wrong
1. ❌ Webhooks weren't reaching the server (no `stripe_subscription_id` in database)
2. ❌ No logging to see what was happening
3. ❌ The code WAS trying to get the interval correctly, but webhooks never fired

## What I Fixed
✅ Added comprehensive logging to see webhook flow
✅ Added better error messages  
✅ Made sure subscription is committed to database
✅ Webhook handler now logs every step

## How to Test (SIMPLE STEPS)

### 1. Start Backend
```powershell
cd d:\Dev\AI_study_assistant
python -m app.main
```

### 2. In Another Terminal: Start Stripe CLI
```powershell
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:8100/api/v1/payments/stripe/webhook
```

**IMPORTANT**: Copy the webhook secret it shows (starts with `whsec_`)

### 3. Add Webhook Secret to .env
Open `.env` and add/update:
```
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_SECRET_HERE
```

### 4. Restart Backend
- Press Ctrl+C in the backend terminal
- Run `python -m app.main` again

### 5. Test Annual Subscription
1. Go to billing page in your app
2. Click Annual plan
3. Click Upgrade
4. Use card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
5. Complete payment

### 6. Watch the Magic! ✨

**In Stripe CLI terminal, you'll see:**
```
checkout.session.completed [evt_xxx]
  --> POST http://localhost:8100/api/v1/payments/stripe/webhook [200]
```

**In backend terminal (or app.log), you'll see:**
```
🔔 Received Stripe webhook
🔔 Processing Stripe event: checkout.session.completed
📦 Session cs_xxx: user_id=xxx, plan_id=xxx
✅ Got billing_interval 'year' from Stripe subscription
✅ Created subscription: interval=year, period=2025-10-11 to 2026-10-11
💾 Subscription saved to database: ID=xxx
```

### 7. Verify in Database
```powershell
python check_stripe_subs.py
```

You should see:
```
✅ Subscription xxx
  Billing Interval: BillingInterval.year  ← THIS SHOULD BE 'year' NOW!
  Stripe Sub ID: sub_xxx  ← THIS PROVES WEBHOOK WORKED!
```

## If It Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Is Stripe CLI running?
```powershell
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:8100/api/v1/payments/stripe/webhook
```

### Check 2: Is webhook secret in .env?
```powershell
cat .env | Select-String "STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
```

### Check 3: Check logs for errors
```powershell
Get-Content app.log -Tail 50
```

### Check 4: Is backend running on port 8100?
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :8100
```

## That's It!
The billing interval issue will be fixed once webhooks are working properly. The code already handles it correctly - it was just never being called!
