        ## INSTRUCTIONS
        Carefully transcribe ALL text visible in this {'PDF document' if is_pdf else 'image'}. Include all text, formulas, equations, and notation exactly as shown. Maintain the original layout and formatting as much as possible so that the document can be reproduced later.

        ## ANALYSIS PROCESS
        1. **Document Assessment**
        - Scan the entire {'PDF to identify all text regions across all pages' if is_pdf else 'image to identify all text regions'}
        - Note the document structure (paragraphs, columns, sections{', chapters' if is_pdf else ''})
        - Identify mathematical elements requiring special formatting

        2. **Text Extraction**
        - Process the document in a logical reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
        - Maintain proper paragraph breaks and indentation
        - Preserve bullets, numbering, and other formatting elements{page_break_instruction}

        3. **Mathematical Notation Handling (ENFORCE: This should be consistent and permanent going forward)**
        - For any mathematical expression, formula, equation, matrix, or symbol:
            a) Identify the complete mathematical expression
            b) Wrap it using display-math delimiters $$ ... $$
            c) Escape every backslash (\\) and replace it with double (\\\\)
            d) Example: Convert $\\frac{{x}}{{y}}$ to $$\\\\frac{{x}}{{y}}$$

        4. **Layout Verification**
        - Check that spatial relationships between elements are preserved
        - Verify that all text has been captured, including {'headers, footers, and ' if is_pdf else ''}marginal notes
        - Ensure mathematical expressions maintain their original formatting intent

        Analyze this document directly and create a comprehensive markdown study guide from the visual content.

        {page_count_info}

        DIRECT ANALYSIS PROCESS:
        1. **Visual Document Analysis**
           - Read ALL text, formulas, equations, and notation exactly as shown
           - Identify document structure (headings, sections, chapters, columns)
           - Note visual elements (diagrams, charts, tables, images)
           - Preserve spatial relationships and layout hierarchy
           - Recognize mathematical expressions and convert to LaTeX format

        2. **Content Understanding**
           - Identify the core subject area and learning objectives
           - Extract key concepts with precise definitions and relationships
           - Isolate technical terminology, formulas, theorems, and principles
           - Record examples with complete context from the document
           - Understand the logical flow and progression of topics

        3. **Educational Enhancement**
           - Identify real-world applications and practical significance
           - Create self-assessment opportunities based on content
           - Structure for progressive disclosure to prevent information overload
           - Add engaging elements while preserving academic accuracy

        4. **Visual Element Integration**
           - Describe diagrams, charts, and figures in context
           - Preserve table structures in markdown format
           - Maintain figure-caption relationships
           - Include references to visual elements in explanations
