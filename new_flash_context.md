Here’s a concise, end‑to‑end outline and checklist to replace the old flash card flow with a standalone Flash Cards experience.

Goal

Make Flash Cards a first‑class study tool (separate from Assessments), aligned with your liquid‑glass UI.
Remove legacy flash_card usage from the assessment flow.

Launch

Design + Scope

IA: Add “Flash Cards” tab to Study Material (Overview | Study Note | Assessments | Flash Cards | Source Preview).
Difficulty: easy | medium | hard at deck level (default medium).
Brand: liquid-glass surfaces, faded green accents, flat buttons; pointer cursors.
MVP features:
Generate deck from material (count + difficulty).
View/manage deck (list of cards).
Study mode (flip, next/prev, hint, progress).
Regenerate/Delete deck.
Optional: create from missed questions (post‑MVP).
Non-goals (for later): spaced repetition, per-card mastery, analytics.
Backend APIs (content only) Model
Single table: flash_card_sets
id, user_id, study_material_id, difficulty, title, description, cards_payload (array of {front, back, hint?, tag?}), total_cards, created_at, updated_at Services/Routes
POST /api/v1/flash-cards/generate
Input: material_id, difficulty, count, optional topic/section.
Output: set_id, total_cards.
GET /api/v1/flash-cards/by-material/{material_id}
Returns latest set (or null).
GET /api/v1/flash-cards/{set_id}
Returns full deck payload.
DELETE /api/v1/flash-cards/{set_id}
Remove deck. Policies
Auth required; set must belong to user.
Plan limits: max cards per deck, decks/month (simple limit check).
Remove flash_cards from assessment generation/validation; forbid mixed types. Quality
Input validation, timeouts to AI, structured errors.
Logging: generation request id, token usage, parse errors.
Frontend UI/UX Routing + State
New tab: /dashboard/study/[materialId] → “Flash Cards” panel (persist tab across reloads).
Optional deep link: /dashboard/study/[materialId]/flash-cards/study. Screens
Empty state (no deck)
Glass panel; difficulty selector, count selector, Generate button.
Deck header (when exists)
Title, difficulty chip, card count, updated at; actions: Study, Shuffle, Regenerate, Delete.
Deck list (manage)
Glass rows showing front (truncate) + quick actions (Edit later).
Study mode
Centered glass card, tap/click to flip, hint toggle, progress bar “x / total”.
Controls: Previous, Flip, Next; keyboard: Space, ←, →; mobile swipe. Style
Use existing glass tokens (as in study grid/PDF toolbar).
Faded green for primary/“correct”; muted red only for destructive.
Flat glass buttons; pointer cursor on interactive elements. Integration
Use existing axios client with auth token.
Persist study UI state locally (last index, shuffle) per set.
Removal/Cleanup
Remove flash_cards from:
Assessment creation payloads and UI.
Backend assessment routes and validation.
Types/enums, question distribution logic, tests, copy.
Delete old flash card components under Assessments.
Redirect any legacy links to the new Flash Cards tab (soft notice).
Update docs and OpenAPI.
QA / Acceptance Functional
Generate deck from a material (all difficulties).
Fetch deck by material; load deck details by set_id.
Study mode navigation/flip/hint; keyboard and mobile gestures.
Regenerate deck; delete deck; plan limit enforcement.
Tab persistence; no flash cards shown in Assessments. UX/Visual
Matches liquid-glass (study grid/PDF toolbar style).
Faded green accents; flat glass buttons; pointer on hover.
Responsive on mobile and desktop. Error/Empty
Graceful errors (no deck found, AI timeout, plan limit).
Skeleton/loading states for generate and fetch. Non‑functional
Auth checks (only owner access).
Rate limit on generation.
Logs free of sensitive content.
Definition of Done

Old flash card UI removed from Assessments.
New Flash Cards tab present and fully functional (generate, view, study, regenerate, delete).
Difficulty supported end‑to‑end.
Visuals aligned with brand glass style.
OpenAPI updated; README/Help updated.
All QA checks pass.
Risks + Mitigations

AI output quality: tighten prompt, post‑validate payload, retry/fallback.
Cost spikes: per‑plan limits + server‑side rate limiting.
User confusion: add one‑time tooltip in Assessments guiding users to the new tab.
Timeline (estimate)

Day 1: Backend routes + model + prompt integration.
Day 2: Frontend new tab + empty/generate + deck header/list.
Day 3: Study mode + polish + cleanup/removal.
Day 4: QA, visual refinements, docs.
Owner matrix

Backend: APIs/model/limits/logging.
Frontend: Routes/components/styles, removal of legacy, tab persistence.
QA: Scenarios across devices; accessibility pass.
This checklist keeps the scope tight, aligns UX with your brand, and fully replaces the old design with the new standalone experience.
